# TheMonkeesApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Design

The Main design was done in Balsamiq Mockups. I used a simple yet elegant framework, bootstrap for my project as it is a great tool for pre-configured css layouts. This allows me to configure the app as I did in my Mockup Templates.

## Additions to Angular CLI

To allow bootstrap to be available within the Angular app I NPM installed bootstrap 4, jquery and tether to allow me to use that framework. 
`npm install bootstrap@4.0.0alpha.6 jquery tether --save`
